C source to 'GtkVim' widget, which embeds a gvim into your application as if it were a normal widget (actually runs a gvim as another process, displaying in your widget via a GtkSocket).

The current version is for GTK2, and unfortunately requires a pached vim.  This is pending, should make it into vim 7.0 in some fashion, and may even make it into 6.4.  I'll update this note as and when a decision is made.

Next step I guess is to extend GtkVim to be a full Bonobo (?) widget to allow more flexible use in applications which support that (like evolution, I think).

==== Old GTK1 notes ====

Versions 1.x require a GTK+ gvim 6.0 and probably GTK+ 1.2.8 or later.

If you have focusing problems, you may also require the following patch to your GTK libraries (inc. the latest [at time of writing] 1.2.10) for automatic focusing (e.g., upon <Tab>) to work correctly.  Point-and-click activation will still work OK without this patch.

Currently still /not/ working is the ability to set the GtkVim widget's focus at startup (gtk_widget_grab_focus() or gtk_window_set_focus()).
